# Building NodeJs API Authentication With JWT Tutorial

This repo shows how to use JWT in Node.js to secure endpoints and even authenticate users.

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identification through the acquisition of credentials and using those credentials to confirm the user’s identity. The authorization process begins if the credentials are legitimate. The authorization process always follows the authentication procedure.

## Authorization
Authorization is the process of allowing authenticated users access to resources by determining whether they have system access permissions. By giving or denying specific licenses to an authenticated user, authorization enables you to control access privileges.
