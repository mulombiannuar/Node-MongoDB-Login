This is a Compose file version 3.1 that defines two services, one network, and one volume. The services are mongodb and mongo-express, which are based on the official Docker images for MongoDB and Mongo Express. The network is mongo-compose-network, which is a bridge network that allows the services to communicate with each other. The volume is mongodb_data_container, which is a named volume that persists the data of the MongoDB service.

The mongodb service uses the latest version of the mongo image, and sets some environment variables to initialize the database, the root user, and the password. It also exposes port 27017 to the host machine, and mounts the mongodb_data_container volume to the /data/db directory inside the container. The service has a restart policy of always, which means it will restart automatically if it stops or fails. The service also has a custom container name of mongo-server, and belongs to the mongo-compose-network.

The mongo-express service uses the latest version of the mongo-express image, and sets some environment variables to configure the web interface, the authentication, and the connection to the MongoDB service. It also exposes port 8081 to the host machine, and links to the mongodb service by its name. The service has a restart policy of always, and belongs to the mongo-compose-network.
